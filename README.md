## The mission
The COGIP is a company which we don't know an all lot about apart that they produce Jean-Michel toys and that they are serious workers check. They also have incredible employees within their rank.

Jean-Christian Ranu works in accounting at the COGIP. He has been using an old, ugly and incomplete software for years, making him go between it and excels sheet. Jean-Christian like paella, crosswords and his coworker Muriel Perrache.

We propose that you code a web application which will respond to the needs and desire of Jean-Christian.

## Learning objectives
**We will evaluate your project based on:**

- Use of different URL parameters and filename
- Use of sanitization to avoid SQL injections
- Validation of data
- Construction of a functional relational database
- Use of correct joins in SQL
- Use of aliases in your SQL request
- Implementation of a CRUD to read, add, modify and delete data
